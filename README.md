### sorry, but the compiled exe could not be uploaded because it is is too large(65.0 MiB), the zip is 64.1 MiB.
luckily,  you can compile it yourself with:
pyinstaller pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed  "/home/tomgk-admin/Documents/malwares/hack-toolkit/payloads/ransomware/ransomware.py"
