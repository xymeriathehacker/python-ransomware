# python ransomware

a ransomware in python  

it can lock the screen and the mouse asking for a password.  

#### sorry, but the compiled exe could not be uploaded because it is is too large(65.0 MiB), the zip is 64.1 MiB.

luckily,  you can compile it yourself with:  

pyinstaller pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed  "/home/tomgk-admin/Documents/malwares/hack-toolkit/payloads/ransomware/ransomware.py"
